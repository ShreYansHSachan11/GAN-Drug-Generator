# AI Drug Discovery Platform

A modern web application that helps doctors and researchers generate novel drug candidates using machine learning. The platform provides an intuitive interface for specifying target diseases and desired drug properties, then generates potential drug candidates using a GAN-based system.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Disease-specific drug candidate generation
- ðŸ”¬ Customizable drug properties selection
- ðŸ’Š Multiple administration route options
- ðŸ“Š Detailed molecular property analysis
- ðŸ“± Responsive design for all devices
- âš¡ Real-time feedback and progress indicators
- ðŸ“„ Comprehensive report generation

## Tech Stack
